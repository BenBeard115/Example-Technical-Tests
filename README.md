# Coding Exercises

## What is it

It is a 45-60 minute exercise where you and an engineer work as a pair writing code to solve a problem.

Similar to when you pair with a colleague, there will be a driver and a navigator. The driver will be the one at the keyboard, whilst the navigator will be making suggestions and asking questions.

You will typically play the role of driver and the engineer will be the navigator.
